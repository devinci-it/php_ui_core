# Composer Core UI Library

## Introduction

The `composer_core_ui` library is a robust PHP package designed to streamline the creation of interactive user interfaces for web applications. With a modular and flexible architecture, the library provides a collection of UI components, each meticulously crafted for specific functionalities. It adheres to established design patterns, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Builder Pattern Implementation

**Overview:**
- The library embraces the builder pattern to simplify the construction of intricate UI components. This approach empowers developers to methodically create and configure UI elements, fostering flexibility and ease of use.

**Example Usage:**
- Developers can harness builder classes like `ActionMenuBuilder`, `ImageInputBuilder`, etc., to construct and customize UI components using a fluent and expressive interface.

### 2. Namespace Organization

**Overview:**
- The library meticulously organizes its classes into meaningful namespaces (`UICore\ActionMenu`, `UICore\ImageInput`, etc.), promoting a clear and structured approach to managing and locating related classes.

**Benefits:**
- Namespaces enhance code organization, mitigate naming conflicts, and elevate overall code maintainability.

### 3. Static Assets Management

**Overview:**
- Essential static assets, including CSS files, JS scripts, and SVG icons, are provided in the `static` directory. These assets enhance the visual and interactive aspects of UI components.

**Usage:**
- Developers can seamlessly include these assets in their projects, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

### 4. Composer Integration

**Overview:**
- The library seamlessly integrates with Composer, the PHP dependency manager. This guarantees easy installation and management of dependencies, simplifying the process for developers to include `composer_core_ui` in their projects.

**Usage:**
- Developers can install the library using Composer, unlocking its features in modern PHP applications.
